## HsH thesis template

This repo contains a LaTeX template for thesis/ thesis proposal (German: Expos√©) writting at Hochschule Hannover HsH (University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover).
The template was created using the web-based TeX-editor [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com). I made it up using several sources and adapted them to the formalia 
provided by HsH. Sample text taken from the website [Office Ipsum](http://officeipsum.com/index.php).

### Usage:
To use the template for own thesis or proposal projects I really recommend to get started with Overleaf first of all. You can download the repo and upload into your Overleaf account as a new project. 
Generation of a .pdf-document can be archived with compiling expose.tex (in Overleaf, I didn't test for other editors atm).

Attention: For connecting GitHub with Overleaf, a premium Overleaf membership is necessary. Here is a short description on how to bypass this problem:


1. Sign in or register in Overleaf.com
2. Download/clone the repo
3. Zip the "overleaf_template_hsh" folder
4. Click the green *New Project* button in Overleaf and hit the *Upload Project* button in the dropdown menu to the left
5. Drag you overleaf_template_hsh.zip folder in there and hit the *Compie* button within expose.tex afterwards
6. Have fun!

### About and support
This template was created on January 4th 2024 by Andre Schomakers, undergraduate student in Medical Information Management (BMI) at Hochschule Hannover. Get in touch with me for recommendations, mistakes or similar. Note
that I'm relatively new to both LaTeX and GitHub.
