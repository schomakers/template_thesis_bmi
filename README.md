## HsH thesis template

This repo contains a LaTeX template for thesis/ thesis proposal (German: Expos√©) writting at Hochschule Hannover HsH (University of Applied Sciences and Arts Hannover).
The template was created using the web-based TeX-editor [Overleaf](https://overleaf.com). I made it up using several sources and adapted them to the formalia 
provided by HsH. Sample text taken from the website [Office Ipsum](http://officeipsum.com/index.php).

### Usage:
To use the template for own thesis or proposal projects I really recommend to get started with Overleaf first of all. You can download the repo and upload into your Overleaf account as a new project. 
Generation of a .pdf-document can be archived with compiling expose.tex (in Overleaf, I didn't test for other editors atm). 

Attention: For connecting GitHub with Overleaf, a premium Overleaf membership is necessary. There is an easy workaround where you click on the green "New project"-button and drag the zipped the "overleaf_template_hsh" folder and


1. Sign in or register in Overleaf.com
2. Download/clone the repo
3. Zip the "overleaf_template_hsh" folder
4. Click the green *New Project* button in Overleaf and hit the *Upload Project* button in the dropdown menu to the left
5. Drag you overleaf_template_hsh.zip folder in there and hit the *Compie* Button afterwards
6. Have fun!

that I'm relatively new to both LaTeX and GitHub.
